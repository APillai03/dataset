Second, a microbial treatment involves applying approximately 500 grams of Bradyrhizobium japonicum culture and 500 grams of PSB/PSM (Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria/Phosphate Solubilizing Microbes) per 75 kg of seed. This approach improves nitrogen fixation and phosphorus availability for better soybean growth.

Alternatively, for pre-emergence weed control, you can use Alachlor at 2 kg a.i./ha, Pendimethalin or Metolachlor, each at 1 kg a.i./ha, or Clomazone at 1 kg a.i./ha. For post-emergence weed management between 15 to 20 days after sowing (DAS), you can apply Imazethapyr at 75 to 100 g a.i./ha or Quizalofop ethyl at 50 g a.i./ha in 750 to 800 liters of water per hectare. Additionally, performing two hand weedings at 21 and 45 DAS can be an effective method to manage weeds. By using these methods, you can effectively manage weeds throughout the growing season and support healthy soybean crop development."
